# Jupiter Energy : Payment Plan Campaign

Jupiter Energy is the leading supplier of clean, renewable energy for the greater Boston area, servicing nearly 5 million customers across 4 counties. To better serve their clients, especially those facing financial hardship, Jupiter is launching a new set of electricity rates and payment plans. These new plans will significantly lower the total cost of energy for their clients in need.

The functionality of this chatbot agent is to identify the customers who could benefit from the new plans.

The chat user will uplaod a CSV file with customer data and a ML model trained on a large dataset will predict customers that are likely to miss payments.
